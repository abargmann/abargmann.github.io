            Receiving SMS messages via Twilio.  In the middle of writing a method that would open a google form and submit the parsed message into the spreadsheet.  Having trouble figuring this out while learning django.  
          </p>  
          <p>
            Learned how to make my localhost accesible to web to test Twilio stuff locally - hugely helpful for debugging.  Using ngrok.

            Set up initial Django app with requisite django-twilio package.  Made mistake of trying to upgrade Python before and had to fix problem with multiple version of Python installed, making sure django was correct in path, and virtualenv was working.
