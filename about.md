---

I like to build products and services that make things easier. Born in NY, I returned after attending Claremont McKenna College (history, philosophy, and economics) to run product at Noodle, a search engine for learning.  I'm a product person that likes data, engineering, and business problems.  Currently in NYC building, learning, and thinking about elder care and how we age.  I like learning about people, cities, and the Internet.
