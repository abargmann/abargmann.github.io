# README 

This is my, Alex Bargmann's personal website.  It's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  I use the [Plain v1](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain.html) theme. 


## Credits

The theme is from [Heiswayi Nrird](http://heiswayi.github.io). It's based on Leonard Lamprecht's [Jekyll theme][1] which was released under [MIT license](LICENSE).
